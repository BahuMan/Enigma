This projects aims to create virtual enigma machines, as they were used by Nazi forces during the second world war.

My approach is as follows:
1. first create code that correctly encodes/decodes individual key presses, based on rotor and plug settings (this seems to work for the M4 variant, with the Donitz message as example)
2. create a UI interface to quickly and conveniently configure the machine, and record "decrypted" output, so I can verify correct workings of the code using already-cracked and widely documented messages
3. create a 3D model of the machine, the rotors and the plugs, so I can virtually manipulate the machine as an operator would've done

# First example: Donitz message

This page clearly describes the steps necessary to decrypt the Donitz message:

# Other examples

This page also shows the Donitz message, but fails to explain how the indicator gruppe "DUHF TETO" translates to "QEOB" as rotor position for the remainder of the message
