These rotors were manufactured with their wirings buried inside and they could not be modified in use. </p><p>In
 the 1930s, the Enigma had only three different kinds of rotor, I II and
 III. These rotors could be assembled on the shaft in any order giving 6
 (i.e. 3x2x1) possible configurations.</p><p>
In 1938 the Germans added rotors IV and V to the repertoire, thus giving
 60 (i.e. 5x4x3) configurations by choosing a set of three rotors from 
the five. Some further wheels were brought into use during the course of
 the war but basically the rotors remained unchanged throughout.</p><p> <a href="https://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/rotorspec.htm"><b>You can see the specific substitutions embodied in the wheels on this page.</b></a> </p><p>
</p><h2> The Military Enigma Machines </h2>
<p>
We are now ready to see the machine actually used by the German armed 
forces, and to go on to the further complications introduced through the
 <em>ring-setting</em> and the <em>plugboard or Steckerverbindung.</em></p><p></p><center>
<img src="The%20Enigma%20-%202_files/Enigpart.jpg" width="500" height="350" border="0"></center>
<p>
You can readily see three rotors in place. In operation, a current 
flowed from right to left then back left to right, so the reflector is 
at the left and the entry disc is at the right.</p><p> The entry disc is
 a fixed disc of 26 contacts. The keyboard contacts are connected to the
 right hand side. The left hand side of the entry disc has metal contact
 discs just like the wheel discs. A curious aspect of the Enigma design 
was that the keyboard was connected to the entry disc in the 
simple order ABCDEF...  and did not take advantage of the opportunity 
for introducing a further scrambling.
</p><p>
As explained above, it is important that the rotors are interchangeable.
 Mechanically, this is effected as follows. When the release lever is 
pulled forward, the reflector slides to the left and the group of three 
rotors can be taken out on their shaft.
Then the operator can assemble a new sequence of rotors on the shaft, 
and  put this back into the machine.

</p><p>The lamp panel shows the enciphered output letter for the 
keyboard key pressed. This was rather a primitive aspect of the Enigma 
as it relied on the operator to observe and write down the lit-up letter
 at each stage of encipherment and decipherment.</p><p>
</p><h2> The plugboard </h2>
The plugboard or 'Stecker', visible on the front of the machine, was the
 most important addition made to the basic Enigma when turning it into a
 machine for military use.
<p>You can compare its effect with the addition of a further rotor to 
effect a scrambling both between the keyboard and the entry disc, and 
between the entry disc and the lamp panel. Unlike the rotors, it could 
be rewired by the operator. However it was not a rotor — it did not 
rotate. And furthermore it did not have the full scrambling power of the
 rotors. It could only effect a 'swapping' of letters, rather as the 
reflector did. The operator simply inserted plugs so as to connect pairs
 of letters (generally 10 pairs, in wartime use) and this had the effect
 of hard-wiring such a swapping. </p><p>

Because the plugboard affected both the incoming current from the 
keyboard and the outgoing current to the lamps. it left unchanged the 
reciprocal property of the Enigma. It also meant that the military 
Enigma still had the property that no letter could ever be enciphered to
 itself. This was a very grave mistake in the design. </p><p>
To see how this worked in more detail, it is best to forget the physical
 picture of the Enigma and concentrate on a logical diagram of how the 
electrical current effected substitutions:</p><p>

The  keyboard was laid out as follows:
</font></p><p><font face="verdana"> <b> <font face="courier" size="6">

A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K<br>
P  Y  X  C  V  B  N  M  L<br>
</font> </b>
</font></p><p><font face="verdana">
The same arrangement was used for the lamp panel and the plugboard.</font></p></center><font face="verdana">

<font face="verdana">
In this illustration, when key W is pressed on the keyboard (5) current 
from the battery (4) flows to the plugboard panel socket W, but socket W
 has been plugged to socket X so current flows up to the entry disc (E) 
at point X.<br>
The current then flows through the internal wiring in the rotors (2) to 
the reflector (1).
Here it is turned round and flows back through the rotors in the reverse
 direction emerging from the entry disc at terminal H.
Terminal H on the Entry disc is connected to socket H on the plugboard 
(6) but this socket is plugged to socket I so finally the current flows 
to lamp I which lights up.<br>
Thus in this instance, the letter W is enciphered to I.
</font></p><p><font face="verdana">
You can now also see that if the key I had been pressed, the lamp W 
would have lit up. This is because the path from W to I through the 
steckers and rotors
remains the same, though with the current flowing in the opposite 
direction.</font></p><p><font face="verdana">When the W key is pressed the
connection to the W lamp is broken and the I lamp lights. If the I key
is now pressed down the connection to the I lamp is broken and the W
lamp lights.<a name="details"></a> <a href="https://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/plugbd.htm">Here is a more technical description of the plugboard.</a>
</font></p><p><font face="verdana">
</font></p><h2><font face="verdana"> The motion of the rotors </font></h2><font face="verdana">
Now you will recall from our introduction that the whole point of the 
rotors is that they must rotate, so that every time a letter is 
enciphered, the machine is in a different configuration. So, when a key 
on the keyboard is pressed down, a mechanical linkage causes the right 
hand rotor to turn by 1/26 of a revolution, i.e. by one letter on the 
alphabet ring.<p>
This means that the next time a key is pressed, the substitution effected by the rotors is quite different.</p><p>

At certain points on the rotation of the right hand rotor, the motion is
 'carried' to the middle rotor, M which then moves on one letter. Carry 
will also occur from the middle to the left hand rotor when the carry 
notch engages, but obviously this will happen much less often.  </p><p>
<font size="2">
(A technical note is needed here for the exact simulation of the 
machine: the Enigma sent the current through the wires AFTER the 
mechanical linkage had moved the right-hand wheel and any other wheels 
knocked on by the carry mechanism.)</font></p><p>


The principle is just the same as the 'carry' on an adding machine 
knocking on to tens, hundreds and thousands, but there is a subtlety in 
the design affecting the point at which the knocking-on occurred.</p><p> To appreciate this we must first describe the alphabet RING settings.

</p><h2> The ring setting </h2>
Referring again to figure 4, not that on each rotor there is a spring 
loaded catch (4). When this is pulled to the right the ring (or tyre) 
can be turned with respect to the core of the rotor. In fact the ring 
for each rotor can be set by the operator in any one of 26 possible 
settings.<p>
The effect of this is that the core which contains the wiring, is turned
 in relation to the letter showing in the window of the Enigma machine.</p><p>
At first sight this extra complication might seem rather pointless 
because it did not change anything to do with the essential scrambling 
going on inside the system. However the indicator systems, to which we 
will come later, depended on describing the 'window position' of the 
rotor, and the ring-setting determined the relationship between the 
window letters and the actual scramblings. Furthermore, the carry 
mechanism is affected by the ring setting. The 'carry' point is in fact 
determined by the position of the carry notch (8) in figure 4, and the 
crucial point is that this notch is attached to the alphabet RING, and 
not to the core of the rotor.<br>

The carry notch was arranged to be in a different position for each of 
the rotors I, II, III, IV, V. This turned out to be a bad cryptographic 
mistake; it helped first the Poles and then the British analysts at 
Bletchley Park to identify the right hand rotor in use.
